# This is my Me-page

My name is Niklas Andersson, I'm 21 years old. I'm from Jönköping and am currently studying my second year at BTH (WIP).

During my spare time I like to keep myself updated with the most recent gadgets and information. I also run a community with the name Sockertoppar (which includes managing a server which runs various different game servers and a Teamspeak server). I also enjoy playing video games from now and then.

## 5 things I like:
* Corgi's
* Ultrawide PC Master Race
* Unnecessary complicated code solutions
* Debugging
* Food
